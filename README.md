This Project is all About Simple Masking using Segment Anything Model (SAM) , Inpainting using Stable Diffusion and removing Anything.

I have used the following models:
1. Segment Anything Model (SAM) : sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth (If GPU is 4GB or less use sam_vit_b_01ec64.pth)
2. segment Anything Model (SAM) : sam_vit_b_01ec64.pth (If GPU is 8GB or more) 

This Project is inspired from the following repositories:
1. https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything?tab=readme-ov-file
2. https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion/blob/main/data/inpainting_examples/6458524847_2f4c361183_k.png

some prompts for inpainting:    
- For girl Image : change hair color to blue, change dress color to red / girl wearing a hat / girl with sunglasses / girl wearing blue jacket
- For dog Image : make the dog look older, change fur color to black and white
- For car Image : change car color to red, make the car look vintage
- For building Image : make the building look futuristic, add greenery around the building
- For food Image : make the food look more delicious, add more toppings on the food


This is Project is made to demonstrate the use of SAM and Stable Diffusion for inpainting and removing objects from images.
I strongly recommend you to use a GPU with at least 8GB VRAM for better performance.




Further Improvements can be made to this project like:
- Use Frontend and Proper Backend

Happing Coding :) (sai)
